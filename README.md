WHAT 
Baird’s sparrow (Centronyx bairdii) is a species that displays adjusted songs in response to oil-well drilling noise (Curry et al. 2017). Previously, there was no research examining if adjusted songs improve acoustic detection in noise or alter biologically important information encoded within signals.

The objectives of the research were to: (1) determine if territorial-defense behavior differed in response to unadjusted songs and noise-adjusted songs in quiet conditions, (2) determine if territorial-defense behavior differed in response to unadjusted songs and noise-adjusted songs in experimentally-elevated noise levels, and (3) determine if territorial-defense differed in quiet and experimentally-elevated noise levels.

This data reflects a repeated measures playback study (n = 69 dyads; n = 138 dyad halves) on free-living male Baird’s sparrows (Centronyx bairdii) (n = 69 individuals). Individual behaviour (songs, calls, flybys passed the song speaker, and song latency) were measured in response to noise treatments and song treatments.

Behavioural, experimental design and weather data was modeled via a suite of generalized linear mixed effects models.

WHEN
This data was collected during the species breeding season (May-July) in the 2018 and 2019 field seasons. Playback studies occurred near-daily and all playback studies occurred before 1:00 PM. 

WHERE
The data was collected in study sites (i.e., male territories) within a 50 km radius of Brooks, Alberta, Canada (50.56417ºN, 111.8989ºW, 760 meters above sea level). The study sites were on large tracts of native and improved pasture lands.

WHY 
The experiment and subsequent data collection was undertaken pursuant to the fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Nautral Resources Managment, University of Manitoba. 

HOW 
Behaviors of focal males were visually observed and dictated into a Zoom H4n Pro Digital Recorder which was later transcribed. Ambient noise recordings were also made using a Zoom H4n Pro Digital Recorder. Weather measurements were made using a Kestrel Weather Meter.
